#In this Final SQL Project, I am querying data that was provided 
  which represented a digital media store and included tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 

--Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'total sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.invoiceid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND i.invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY (round(sum(i.total), 2)) DESC 
LIMIT 1;

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
  The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, inv.invoiceid 
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON c.customerid = inv.invoiceid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--Write a query that shows the total price paid by each state in the USA.
SELECT SUM(quantity)*unitprice AS pricepaid, billingstate
FROM invoice_items
JOIN invoices
ON invoice_items.InvoiceId = invoices.InvoiceId
WHERE billingcountry = 'USA'
GROUP BY billingstate;

--List the titles of the 10 albums, and the name of their media types.
SELECT a.title, m.name
FROM albums a
JOIN tracks t
ON a.albumid = t.trackid
JOIN media_types m
ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
LIMIT 10;

--List the last names of the employees and the postalcodes of customers that they are support representatives for.
SELECT distinct postalcode, e.lastname
FROM customers c
JOIN employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
ORDER BY e.lastname;

--How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate 
BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
