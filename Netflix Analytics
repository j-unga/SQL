-In this SQL code I am using PostgreSQL to answer questions by querying a database that consists of Netflix data.

--Displays the director, title and description of the Netflix movie/show
SELECT np.director, nti.title, nti.description
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nti
ON np.show_id = nti.show_id;

--How many movies are listed on this database?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type = 'Movie'; 

--When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max(date(date_added)) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--Displays the title of the movies/tv shows in alphabetical order
SELECT title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY title ASC;

--Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT np.director, nti.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nti
ON np.show_id = nti.show_id 
WHERE title = 'Bright Star';

--What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC LIMIT 5;
